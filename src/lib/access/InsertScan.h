  @brief The InsertScan allows to insert a single row into the database

  The idea of this scan is to create a plan operation that allows to
  insert a new row to the database. To achieve this we have to cope
  with different problems.

  @li Make sure that the data is persisted on disk as well
  @li Make sure the data is correctly distributed along all container
